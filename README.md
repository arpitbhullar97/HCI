This is the prototype of a simple, easily accessible 'My Courses' app that allows the users of any age or technical expertise to access it without difficulty.
The top 5 most desirable features are:
1. It will allow the users to create alerts/reminders for anything that's due.
2. It will be a one stop shop for all their scholarly needs, be it communicating with the faculty, accessing course materials, joining virtual classes, group chatting etc.
3. It will allow the students( users) to be aware of any events happening in the college.
4. It will allow them to create their own chat groups.
5. It will allow to directly create reminders from the Assignments section. 

Below are the links to the figma prototype and a video explaining all the new features:
