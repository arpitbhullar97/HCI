This is the prototype of a simple, easily accessible 'My Courses' app that allows the users of any age or technical expertise to access it without difficulty.
Its most prominent features are:
1. It will allow them to create alerts/reminders for anything that's due.
2. It will be a one stop shop for all their scholarly needs, be it communicating with the faculty, accessing course materials, joining virtual classes, group chatting etc.
3. It will allow the students( users) to be aware of any events happening in the college.
